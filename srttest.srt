00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:05,739
Hi!

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:09,290
Welcome, thanks for
coming to the psychology of popularity.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,610
I'm glad that you selected this course.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,066
And I'm excited to tell you about some
of the work that I've been doing and

6
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:18,890
lots of researchers have been
doing in the area of popularity.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,720
But when we talk about popularity,
a lot of people will sometimes say

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,290
is this really a subject that
people study in psychology?

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,140
Isn't this just something that
is important in high school or

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,030
in adolescence?

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,530
What difference does this
really make in the real world?

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,660
So maybe a good way to start is for
us to talk a little bit about

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,350
how popularity really does
play an important role.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,660
And it plays an important role actually
throughout the entire lifespan.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,640
So, first of all,

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,110
of course when we think about who cares
about popularity we think about children.

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,540
And in this graphic what you can see is
that even starting at very young ages,

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,350
and this graphic is from over 30
years ago, children spend far more

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,220
time of their waking hours surrounded by
their peers than surrounded by adults.

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,605
And you can see here that between
the ages of about two all the way until

21
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:15,410
pre-adolescence, there's this dramatic and
increasing tendency for

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,700
kids to interact with their peers.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,230
So of course, if those interactions
are aversive, difficult,

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,430
filled with victimization that's going to
have a big effect on the developing child.

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,520
What you don't see after
this graphic is that

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,450
these trends just increase
dramatically into adolescence.

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,323
So once kids get into adolescence,

28
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,890
of course, it's totally uncool
to spend any time with adults.

29
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,944
And we see even more increases in
the amount of time spent with peers.

30
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:48,550
In fact, what we know is that starting
at the age of three, young children can

31
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,940
already tell you which kids are the most
popular, which kids are the least popular,

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,710
and which kids are kind of not
affiliating with their peers at all.

33
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,390
So starting from very, very early
in childhood, popularity becomes

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,590
a really important construct, a variable,
that really has impact over time.

35
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,240
Now once we pass through childhood and
we get into adolescence,

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,430
there are actually some biological reasons
why popularity starts playing a big role.

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,184
So what you can see here,
this is a graphic of the brain.

38
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:22,740
And what we know now is that
from the time that the pubertal

39
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,950
transition starts,
adolescents brains start to mature, but

40
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,060
the whole brain doesn't mature
at the exact same time.

41
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,840
It actually starts in the back and

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,900
then the development of the brain
kind of moves up forward.

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,560
So what that means is that the parts of
the brain that are developing the most

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,670
are the parts that are below the cortex.

45
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,980
In other words, the parts that
are shared with most mammals.

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,750
And those things are kind of instinctual
drives and things that you want for

47
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,430
quick rewards.

48
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,080
And one of those pieces in the limbic
system that's really important

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,860
is the desire for social rewards.

50
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,770
And the reason why in adolescence
there's this big push for

51
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,060
our brains telling us to go out and
get social rewards,

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,200
is because it's a way of helping us
to develop autonomy from adults.

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,720
It's basically telling us,
your parents aren't cool anymore.

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,538
You want to be able to go out and
learn how to be self sufficient.

55
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:22,070
You're not going to be taking care of by
your parents for the rest of your life.

56
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,790
So our brains make us really
interested in hanging out with peers,

57
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,580
being very excited about
what happens with peers.

58
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,520
And as a result, we tend to be
very interested in whatever we

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,080
can do to make us want to get
rewards from people our age.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,230
And simultaneously,
we become less interested in adults, so

61
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,970
that's totally natural.

62
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,250
Unfortunately all that develops before the
part of the brain in the front that helps

63
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,300
us to exert control over those impulses
and keep us from doing things impulsive.

64
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,280
That doesn't develop until later, so we
don't really see that happen which is why

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,240
in adolescence there's lots
of risk taking behavior.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,230
So that's why we see this huge increase
in a desire to do what peers do and

67
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,920
care what peers think in adolescence.

68
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,490
So that's a big part of what's
happening as we grow up.

69
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,120
And of course, when we think about
adolescence usually the things we remember

70
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,730
the most are not the things that
happened with our parents or

71
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,810
the things that happened with
our courses in high school.

72
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,020
But we're really think
about who was popular,

73
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,850
how much was I embarrassed
in front of other peers?

74
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,040
How much can I make sure that I'm meeting
people to be friends with or to date, and

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,030
that becomes really important.

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,108
So what about with adults?

77
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,860
Well, I mean, one interesting thing
about adulthood is that for some reason,

78
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,330
adults love talking about their
adolescence in terms of popularity.

79
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,810
And if you look at things that
you see on TV, or songs, or

80
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,540
especially movies out there, there are
tons of movies that kind of bring us back

81
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,160
to those times in adolescence.

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,510
And we really are talking about
peer relationships and friendships.

83
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,790
There's a reason why we're
really interested in that and

84
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,230
that's from nostalgic value.

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,940
But maybe there's a reason why we
also care about popularity as adults.

86
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,680
That has to do with present day.

87
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,540
If you think about it, there are a lot
of ways that in our adulthood life,

88
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,960
we are still thinking about and
probably really affected by popularity.

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
And hopefully that's why you're here.

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,100
You're here so that way you can get
an idea about how popularity is

91
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,910
affecting how happy you are today,
how successful you are today and

92
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,950
how your relationships are going today.

93
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,430
There are a lot of different
ways that we see this and

94
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,670
probably now much more than we
have seen for decades earlier.

95
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,425
We see all this reflected in social media.

96
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:45,450
So social media is really pulling us
all back into that adolescent world of

97
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,920
caring about who responded
to our Facebook likes and

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,180
posts and
how many Twitter followers we have.

99
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,360
And which pictures we put up, and how
many people have paid attention to that.

100
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,200
It's kind of in a way of playing out this
idea of popularity all over again, but

101
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,100
it's doing it in a way that's explicit and
measurable and

102
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,180
there are numbers next to it.

103
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,840
And people sometimes even
get very hyped up about

104
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,810
how often their posts have
been paid attention to.

105
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,570
Or they seem to try and get more
relationships through social media.

106
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,830
So it's affecting us as adults.

107
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,470
It's certainly affecting these
adolescents growing up today.

108
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,050
But it's also affecting us as adults.

109
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,930
Another way that we really
see popularity playing a role

110
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,340
is our big fixation with celebrities.

111
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,820
And if you think about it,

112
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,590
celebrities are kind of the popular
kids in the adult high school.

113
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,430
For some reason, and all you have to
do is go to the grocery store and

114
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,420
kind of see all the magazines there.

115
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,730
We are remarkably concerned
about what they're doing and

116
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,850
what they look like and what they say and
what their opinions are.

117
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,720
This is even a big marketing strategy to
get celebrity endorsers with the idea that

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,810
if a celebrity buys a product or

119
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,240
espouses a world view, we might be
more likely to have similar attitudes.

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,600
And the reason why is it's playing up
on these same ideas of popularity that

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,710
we will see what those people
do as highly influential.

122
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,130
In fact, a lot of marketing
is really geared towards

123
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,860
leveraging the same types of
popularity dynamics in current day.

124
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,350
And when you think about marketing from
the perspective of political marketing.

125
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,970
We're really seeing that when
it comes to campaigns and

126
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,080
presidential campaigns, there's really
a way in which we're trying to be pulled

127
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,380
towards the same types
of popularity politics.

128
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,460
And that really plays an important role.

129
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,180
And it's something that's
effecting our whole culture.

130
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,840
And that has a lot to do with popularity.

131
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,670
But, even if we go beyond
the perspective of the entire culture,

132
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,830
how is popularity affecting your life?

133
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,960
What are things that you are experiencing
every day that have a lot to

134
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,260
do with popularity, as many of us have
studied it, in childhood and adolescence?

135
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,210
Well If you work in an office with other
people, then you've probably noticed

136
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,420
that there are some ways that the office
has some of the kinds of cliques and

137
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,350
groups and
reputations that there was in high school.

138
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,570
It might be far more sophisticated.

139
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,440
It might be presented in a way
that's a little bit different.

140
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,430
No one is kind of playing
on a playground or

141
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,244
teasing kids that have to sit in
the corner of the room in the workplace.

142
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:23,420
But there are ways in which some people
tend to have much more influence

143
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,330
in meetings, people really want
to hear what they have to say,

144
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,540
they have a way of really
getting people laughing.

145
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,490
They might stand in the door frame having
conversations with their coworkers a lot.

146
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,630
Where as other people,
they're not invited to lunch,

147
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,730
they really aren't someone that
people want to affiliate with.

148
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,880
Turns out that really
affects work performance.

149
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,800
That affects how much the company,
overall, is successful.

150
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,530
That even affects how long people
will stay in their job, and

151
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,090
a lot of that has to do with popularity.

152
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,860
We also see this of course,
play a role in all of our relationships.

153
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,440
So whether it's our
adulthood friendships and

154
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,410
how much we feel we're getting support
from friends in times of stress.

155
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,300
Or how much we feel in
our friendship groups.

156
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,960
There are some people
who tend to be the boss.

157
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,680
And tell everyone what they're doing and
what the plans are and

158
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,380
whose house you're meeting at.

159
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,180
Versus those that tend to still feel
a little bit like they're on the outskirts

160
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,140
of the social group.

161
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,990
Or they're not the ones in
the neighborhood that are often

162
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,800
invited to all of the events.

163
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,990
That's all about popularity too.

164
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,210
In fact, we even see that play a big
role when it comes to romantic partners.

165
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,510
Who you meet, how dating goes,
how we feel during a date.

166
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,180
Then afterwards, our satisfaction
in our marital relationships or

167
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,350
other kinds of romantic partnerships.

168
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,850
A lot of that stems from the things
we learn about popularity.

169
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,990
Of course, for those of us that
are parents, in our adulthood,

170
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,030
we also find that parenting is something
really tied into popularity, as well.

171
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,200
We know that the way that you
experience popularity as a child

172
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,880
as related to the kind of parent you are.

173
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,580
And we also know that it affects you're
own children's level of popularity and

174
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,410
whether they do well at school or
if they don't do as well with their peers.

175
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,140
We also know that how kids
deal with popularity today,

176
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,470
especially in the world of social media,
is very different than how we all dealt

177
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,530
with these things back when we were kids,
way before social media even got started.

178
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,840
So that's something we're
going to talk about as well.

179
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,073
So overall,
what we're going to talk about for

180
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:33,430
the rest of this course is specifically
why popularity is so important.

181
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,250
Why is it that this is something that we
all seem to care so much about when we're

182
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,882
young, and it continues to play out in
all these different ways in adulthood?

183
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:47,710
We're going to talk also about how
we study popularity scientifically.

184
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,998
And using that scientific research,
what do we know about what predicts who's

185
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:56,440
popular across lots of different
settings and across the lifespan?

186
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,750
And how popularity predicts
our life outcomes overall.

187
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,885
And we're going to talk about all of these
things over the course of the next few

188
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:07,280
lectures so thanks again for joining.

189
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,690
Really excited that you're here and

190
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,630
excited to keep on going
with the next clip.
