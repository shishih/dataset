1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,470
Jack: What about
the Geneva Bible?

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,000
That was certainly
a precursor,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,530
because there were
a number of precursor

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,500
English Bibles
before the King James,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
starting with William Tyndale's
1525 edition New Testament,

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,570
and from there,
there was the Matthews Bible (1537),

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,980
and Coverdale (1535),
and the Great Bible (1539-41),

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,500
and the Geneva (1560),
and the Bishops (1568).

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,699
There was also
another one, the Taverner's (1539).

10
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:37,120
So there were
a number of English Bibles.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,320
And now the question
has come up,

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,750
"Well, what about
all those previous English Bibles?"

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,730
And especially,
people are talking about

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,890
the Geneva Bible.
What does your research

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,790
show you about the Geneva?

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,690
David: Well, the bottom line:
I call it,

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,260
"Close, but no banana."
It's really close.

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,180
It has a lot of
really good points to it.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,149
It's based on pretty much
the right text.

20
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,100
But there are
some compromises in it.

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,789
And there are
some changes in it.

22
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,630
Sam Gipp has written something
on that ("The 2006 Geneva Bible:

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,860
The Trojan Horse") and put
some things together.

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,220
I found some stuff
as well with my 1599.

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,630
You could look them up.
But the bottom line is

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,860
they weren't as literal,
clear with the Hebrew

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,920
and the Greek,
so the meaning

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,030
could stand up like the KJV.
So you wouldn't

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,210
even have to hold
the Hebrew or the Greek.

30
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,770
You have the King James Bible,
now, here,

31
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,369
and you can look through it
and see the language

32
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,810
right there,
because it's

33
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,200
the same meaning.
God transferred it.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,140
But sometimes
they played little games.

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,630
They weren't as clear.
They weren't as defined

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,810
in giving us
exactly what God said

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,310
and kind of paraphrased
a little bit.

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,549
And sometimes
they added in

39
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,729
some side doctrines
that actually

40
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,479
are not correct.
The Geneva did it

41
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,920
a few times.
I don't want to get into

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,570
all that right now.

43
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,049
Jack: I don't
think that's necessary.

44
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,380
But one of the arguments
for the KJV, or

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,549
one of the things
they wanted to accomplish

46
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,290
with the King James Bible,
was that it

47
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,130
wouldn't have any notes.
It wasn't a study Bible,

48
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,799
so to speak.
You should study it,

49
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,320
but it wasn't a study Bible.

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,899
David: Well, yeah,
because all the notes

51
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,310
that were in the Geneva,
they really got into

52
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,260
a lot of issues,
kind of like getting

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,249
Hal Lindsey's books on prophecy
and somebody else's stuff on politics

54
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,159
and kind of
blending them all together,

55
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,389
and putting them
all in the side notes.

56
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,340
It kind of detracts from
the fact that you want

57
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,749
what God said.

58
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,760
And so when
the King James Bible

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,189
was put together,
the idea was that

60
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,010
you read IT.
And, of course,

61
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,529
cross-references help us
as we learn

62
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,409
to read our Bible and
as we learn

63
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:39,239
what relates to what.
It was just too many notes

64
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,209
in the Geneva.
And really,

65
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,629
read them for yourself.
Go download it.

66
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,849
Check it out for yourself.
You'll see why

67
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,620
some of them are
just downright silly.

68
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,629
And some of them
--I mean

69
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,299
the world would have ended
a long time before now

70
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:53,040
if you believed their view
of prophecy. (See Revelation notes, etc.)

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,219
Jack: Interesting.
That's good to know.
