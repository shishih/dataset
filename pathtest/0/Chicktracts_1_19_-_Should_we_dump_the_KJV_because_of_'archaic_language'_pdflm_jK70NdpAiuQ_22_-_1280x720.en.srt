1
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,330
Jack: Now,
one of the objections

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,769
that we get is,
"Nobody can understand it.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,200
Nobody can understand
the King James Bible.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,580
The words are too difficult."

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,820
David: That's so funny!
Because people

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,630
take college classes
all the time, and

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,310
they learn
new vocabulary words.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,390
You pay a lot of money
to a college

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,039
for a company
to employ you, and

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,140
they teach you
new vocabulary words.

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,280
There's only what,
600 words or so

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,960
in this?
And that's nothing.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,529
The vocabulary of
the whole King James Bible,

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,210
as I've said
in one of my vlogs,

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,460
is the amount of vocabulary
of a five and a half year old.

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,969
My kids were reading
the King James Bible

17
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:42,329
at that age.
My friends' kids

18
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,149
actually learned to read
off the King James Bible.

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,239
One of my kids also did.
It's not a matter of

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,069
difficulty of words.
It's just a matter of

21
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:52,269
learning them,
just like anything else.

22
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:55,409
Jack: Well now,
I have another question.

23
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:56,579
What about
the modern versions,

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,639
like the NIV, or
the New King James?

25
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,809
Those are pretty popular.
The ESV is another

26
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,670
popular version now.
Are there any

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,330
difficult words in those?

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,420
David: There are.
There's a book called

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,290
"Archaic Words and
the Authorized Version"

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,120
(by Laurence M. Vance). You can
still get a copy of it,

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,610
I'm sure.
And it will show you

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,900
that all the Bibles
have these kind of words

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,700
in them - pretty much
--and you have to learn them

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,770
in any Bible.
It's really a fake argument

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,630
to get you to say,
"Oh, it's too hard!"

36
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,130
Again,
my kids would say,

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,490
"No, it's not."
And it's really sad

38
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,380
when a little kid
can put a scholar

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,190
with a Ph.D to shame,
by understanding the Bible

40
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,960
better than he does.

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,620
Jack: Interesting.
And you know

42
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,030
it's true,
even when you play sports,

43
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,270
you have to learn a position.
Don't you have to learn

44
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,409
the names of a position?
Or if you're a carpenter,

45
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:51,740
don't you have to know
what a soffit,

46
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,180
a fascia, or ridge,
any of these things is?

47
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,970
So it's not surprising that
if you're gonna

48
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,560
learn something as important
as the Bible,

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,979
that you're also gonna
have to learn

50
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,000
some vocabulary words.
We learn

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,099
vocabulary words
in business.

52
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,220
No matter
what business you're in

53
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,980
you get trained and
you learn the nomenclature

54
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,629
of that particular business.
So what a surprise that

55
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,620
you have to learn it
for a Bible

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,139
that's more important
than any of

57
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,269
the other things that we do.

58
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,829
So there's one of the things
you can use,

59
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:30,879
this little Companion dictionary
that can go right in your Bible

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,209
if you ever have any questions.
And you'll

61
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,379
pick up the words really quickly,
anyway.
