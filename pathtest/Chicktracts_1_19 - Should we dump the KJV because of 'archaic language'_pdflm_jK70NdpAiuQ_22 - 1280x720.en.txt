Jack: Now,
one of the objections

that we get is,
"Nobody can understand it.

Nobody can understand
the King James Bible.

The words are too difficult."

David: That's so funny!
Because people

take college classes
all the time, and

they learn
new vocabulary words.

You pay a lot of money
to a college

for a company
to employ you, and

they teach you
new vocabulary words.

There's only what,

in this?
And that's nothing.

The vocabulary of
the whole King James Bible,

as I've said
in one of my vlogs,

is the amount of vocabulary
of a five and a half year old.

My kids were reading
the King James Bible

at that age.
My friends' kids

actually learned to read
off the King James Bible.

One of my kids also did.
It's not a matter of

difficulty of words.
It's just a matter of

learning them,
just like anything else.

Jack: Well now,
I have another question.

What about
the modern versions,

like the NIV, or
the New King James?

Those are pretty popular.
The ESV is another

popular version now.
Are there any

difficult words in those?

David: There are.
There's a book called

"Archaic Words and
the Authorized Version"

(by Laurence M. Vance). You can
still get a copy of it,

I'm sure.
And it will show you

that all the Bibles
have these kind of words

in them - pretty much
--and you have to learn them

in any Bible.
It's really a fake argument

to get you to say,
"Oh, it's too hard!"

Again,
my kids would say,

"No, it's not."
And it's really sad

when a little kid
can put a scholar

with a Ph.D to shame,
by understanding the Bible

better than he does.

Jack: Interesting.
And you know

it's true,
even when you play sports,

you have to learn a position.
Don't you have to learn

the names of a position?
Or if you're a carpenter,

don't you have to know
what a soffit,

a fascia, or ridge,
any of these things is?

So it's not surprising that
if you're gonna

learn something as important
as the Bible,

that you're also gonna
have to learn

some vocabulary words.
We learn

vocabulary words
in business.

No matter
what business you're in

you get trained and
you learn the nomenclature

of that particular business.
So what a surprise that

you have to learn it
for a Bible

that's more important
than any of

the other things that we do.

So there's one of the things
you can use,

this little Companion dictionary
that can go right in your Bible

if you ever have any questions.
And you'll

pick up the words really quickly,
anyway.
